                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-8">How We Met</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Claire and Jonny’s first date was at a Mexican restaurant near their workplace. Claire thought
                    Jonny
                    was very thoughtful by choosing a nearby place and Jonny was excited they had a happy hour!</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Jonny warned Claire that he would be dressed like a palm tree, showing up in a Hawaiian shirt and
                    with a sweat towel.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Claire wore her first date outfit that is tasteful enough for work, but with the change of a
                    button
                    works perfectly for a date!</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Originally Claire had said she would have to leave to pick up a friend from the bus station, a
                    lie
                    Jonny saw through immediately and poked fun at. During the date one of Jonny’s friends “happened
                    to”
                    stop by, but Claire didn’t mind as he left quickly and giving his stamp of approval; Jonny
                    didn’t
                    need an out.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">As the date continued, Claire’s friend magically didn’t need to be picked up anymore!</p>
                <p class="mb-4">A few days after their first date, Claire had to travel for work and much to her liking, Jonny
                    was
                    texting and calling her every day.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Everything was going swimmingly when all of a sudden Covid... To be safe, Jonny asked Claire to
                    his
                    parent’s house in Maine. Thinking it would just be a weekend (a week at most) Claire brought
                    five
                    pairs of underwear and no sweatpants. Jonny’s folks, Lisa and Mitch, didn’t mind and welcomed
                    her
                    with open arms.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The spikes of covid were stressful, but Claire found a home and safe place. Not just in Maine but
                    in
                    Jonny.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Eventually, Claire drove back home to be close to her parents, Jonny soon wanted to make the
                    visit.
                    He came to Minnesota, got to see Mark Larson’s hometown of St. Paul (inside joke) and loved
                    introducing the whole Larson family to new food. From there, the families were hooked and so
                    were
                    Jonny and Claire!</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The culmination of their relationship happened in a vineyard in Argentina, where Jonny proposed
                    to
                    the love of his life, Claire.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">They haven’t looked back and are so excited to celebrate the future together!</p>
